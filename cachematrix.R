## these functions cache the inverse of a matrix

## makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix" which is really a list containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse
## 4. get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y){
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getsolve <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,
       getsolve = getsolve)
}


## cacheSolve computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix
## above.  If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the
## cacheSolve will retrieve the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getsolve()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(m)
  m
}
